// Problem Description – promiseAny(promises)

// You are required to implement a function named promiseAny that accepts an array of Promises.
// The function should return a new Promise that resolves immediately when any one of the input promises resolves successfully.
// If all the promises reject, the returned Promise should reject with an error.
function promiseAny(promises) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let rejectedCount = 0;
    const errors = [];

    if (promises.length === 0) {
      reject(new AggregateError([], "Empty iterable"));
      return;
    }

    promises.forEach((promise, index) => {
      Promise.resolve(promise)
        .then(resolve)
        .catch((error) => {
          errors[index] = error;
          rejectedCount++;

          if (rejectedCount === promises.length) {
            reject(new AggregateError(errors, "All promises were rejected"));
          }
        });
    });
  });
